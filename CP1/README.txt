To run my code, run cycles.py
To plot k_eff over all cycles, run plotkeff.py
To plot the flux, run plotflux.py

setup.py contains the parameters of the problem, such as number of histories, number of cycles, geometric specifications, and material definitions.
col_type.py is a function to determine the type of collision. cycles.py calls col_type
